# Dataset: Cars Details
Craigslist is the world's largest collection of used vehicles for sale, yet it's very difficult to collect all of them in the same place. I built a scraper for a school project and expanded upon it later to create this dataset which includes every used vehicle entry within the United States on Craigslist.



# Dataset: Machine Predictive Maintenance Classification Dataset (Classification)
Since real predictive maintenance datasets are generally difficult to obtain and in particular difficult to publish, we present and provide a synthetic dataset that reflects real predictive maintenance encountered in the industry to the best of our knowledge.

The dataset consists of 10,000 data points stored as rows with 14 features in columns

- UID: unique identifier ranging from 1 to 10000
- productID: consisting of a letter L, M, or H for low (50% of all products), medium (30%), and high (20%) as product quality variants and a variant-specific serial number
- air temperature [K]: generated using a random walk process later normalized to a standard deviation of 2 K around 300 K
- process temperature [K]: generated using a random walk process normalized to a standard deviation of 1 K, added to the air temperature plus 10 K.
- rotational speed [rpm]: calculated from powepower of 2860 W, overlaid with a normally distributed noise
- torque [Nm]: torque values are normally distributed around 40 Nm with an Ïƒ = 10 Nm and no negative values.
- tool wear [min]: The quality variants H/M/L add 5/3/2 minutes of tool wear to the used tool in the process. and a
'machine failure' label that indicates, whether the machine has failed in this particular data point for any of the following failure modes are true.

## Important : There are two Targets - Do not make the mistake of using one of them as feature, as it will lead to leakage.
- Target : Failure or Not
- Failure Type : Type of Failure

# Dataset: Predict Customer Lifecycle Value (Regression)
Using Watson Analytics, you can predict behavior to retain your customers. You can analyze all relevant customer data and develop focused customer retention programs.

## Inspiration
Understand customer demographics and buying behavior. Use predictive analytics to analyze the most profitable customers and how they interact. Take targeted actions to increase profitable customer response, retention, and growth.
